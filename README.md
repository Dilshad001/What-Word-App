This project is a web-based micro application called "What word Application". It allows users to categorize words from a given CSV file into
food, non-food & utensil categories. After the categorization is done, it allows users to generate a CSV file for each given category.


In this project, the majority of codes are written in index.html and app.py:

Working of index.html

Form Structure:
The HTML file structures a form that includes categorized lists of items using headings like "Food," "Non-Food," and "Utensils."
Checkboxes are provided for each item, enabling users to select their preferences.

User Interaction:
Users can interact with the checkboxes to select items of interest across different categories.
The form also includes buttons to trigger the generation of CSV files for each category.

Interface Design:
The design ensures ease of use by categorizing items and presenting them in an organized manner, making it intuitive for users to make selections.



Working of app.py

Flask Integration:
 Flask is utilized to create routes that handle various functionalities of the application.
 Routes are established to render the initial data on the webpage and to process and save selected items into CSV files.
